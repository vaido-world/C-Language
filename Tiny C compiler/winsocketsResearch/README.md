## 2020-09-21 Update: 
I was abled to finally use winsocket in a program.  
Simply you just have to compile the latest TCC compiler.

The precompiled compilers on http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/tinycc/  
Did not work, they are outdated.

Here is a tutorial for compiling Tiny C Compiler:  
https://github.com/vaido-world/C-Language-Tutorial/tree/master/Tiny%20C%20compiler/compilingTCC

After compilation simply use the newly compiled latest TCC
and test if Winsockets works for you:


Compile the below example this way: `tcc WinSocktest.c -lws2_32`  
The output should look like this:
```
C:\Users\boqsc\Desktop\built>WinSocktest.exe
socket id: 172
```

### WinSocktest.c
```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <winsock2.h>

 

int

main() {

    WSADATA wsaData;

    SOCKET so;

    (void)WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2,2), &wsaData);

    so = socket(AF_UNSPEC, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);

    printf("socket id: %d\n", so);

    closesocket(so);

    WSACleanup();   

}

 

C:>tcc foo.c -lws2_32 && foo

Socket id: 180
```

~~I'm unable to make winsockets to work.  
These are only trials that do not work. ~~

## Winsock Distribution

#### previous research
ws2_32.dll is **probably** distributed via  vc_redist.x64.exe and vc_redist.x86.exe
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads
#### latest research
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsastartup
> The Winsock2.h header file for Winsock 2 support is included with the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).

#### ws2tcpip.h
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.19041.0\um\ws2tcpip.h`
#### WinSock2.h
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.19041.0\um\WinSock2.h`


## Initialization of winsock
> **The Ws2_32.dll loads the service provider's interface DLL into the system by using the standard Microsoft Windows dynamic library loading mechanisms, and initializes it by calling WSPStartup.** This is typically triggered by an application calling either socket or WSASocket to create a new socket to be associated with a service provider whose interface DLL is not currently loaded into memory. **The path to each service provider's interface DLL is stored by the Ws2_32.dll** at the time the service provider is being installed. See Installation and Configuration Functions for more information.

## The default path to Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)

``C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\``
## Estimated size of Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)
> 2,6gb
