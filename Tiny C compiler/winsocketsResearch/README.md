I'm unable to make winsockets to work.  
These are only trials that do not work.

## Winsock Distribution

#### previous research
ws2_32.dll is **probably** distributed via  vc_redist.x64.exe and vc_redist.x86.exe
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads
#### latest research
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsastartup
> The Winsock2.h header file for Winsock 2 support is included with the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).


## Initialization of winsock
> **The Ws2_32.dll loads the service provider's interface DLL into the system by using the standard Microsoft Windows dynamic library loading mechanisms, and initializes it by calling WSPStartup.** This is typically triggered by an application calling either socket or WSASocket to create a new socket to be associated with a service provider whose interface DLL is not currently loaded into memory. **The path to each service provider's interface DLL is stored by the Ws2_32.dll** at the time the service provider is being installed. See Installation and Configuration Functions for more information.
