```
Environment Variables have been reloaded.
Tiny C Compiler has been Appended to the PATH variable using Registry. (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment) (Path REG_EXPAND_Z)
TCC compiler is now available for the new Command Prompt processes!
Type tcc --version
```
Reloads Windows Environment variables for new processes.

* Works the same as the Official Windows "Edit the system environment variables" GUI.
* Command Prompts that are already opened will not be affected. (Same as using "Edit the system environment variables" GUI)
  * Therefore Active Command Prompts have to Set Environment variables themselves to get them reloaded.
   ```
   for /f "tokens=2*" %%A in ('REG QUERY "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v Path ^|FIND /I "Path"') DO (
  SET path=%%B
  )
   
   ```
